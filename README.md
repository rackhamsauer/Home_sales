# Home_sales
The purpose of this assignment was to use SParkSQL with Pyspark to determine key metrics about home sales data within a data set. I created temporary views, partitioned the data, cached and uncached temporary tables and used that data to find out averages of home prices over a variety of time spans. I utilized previous class materials, other students, tutor, chat gpt and stack overflow to complete this assignment.
